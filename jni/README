This is appendix of the Phrack (www.phrack.org) article:
Android platform based linux kernel rootkit
The sample rootkit code

All the tests were done on Motoroi XT720 model(2.6.29-omap1 kernel)
and Galaxy S SHW-M110S model(2.6.32.9 kernel).
Note that some contents may not apply to all smart platform machines
and there are some bugs you can modify.

This code can be used as a real code for attack or just a proof-of-
concept code. I wish you use this code only for your study not for a bad 
purpose.

USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!

These days, the main issue that strikes Korea is small rocky island "Dokdo".
You can get more detailed information from following websites.

"Japanese goverment has to follow and learn from German goverment"

I can confidently say "Dokdo is belong to Korea".

1) Their claim that the East Sea has some historical precedent worked,
as some major book and map publishers, educational web sites and other
reference materials now include the East Sea name along with the Sea of Japan.

2) On historical perspective and in international law, why there
is no valid dispute over the ownership of Dokdo.
